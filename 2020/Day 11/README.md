# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 11

This was the first day that I didn't have time to start right when it was released as I was doing my final project for a class. I started this puzzle right when I woke up and it was really fun! I again went with an Object-Oriented approach and it made the puzzle super easy! The rules were clearly written in the puzzle and made it straightforward to implement. My organization for part 1 also made it easy to update the rules to get the result for part 2. I think I may make a visualization for this puzzle later today as it seems quite easy to do!
