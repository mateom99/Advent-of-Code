# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 5

This puzzle was amazing for so many reasons! This puzzle must have been a million times harder to make than it was to solve. Part 1 was basically a simple binary search but part 2 is where it all came together. I had to reread part 2 a couple of times but quickly understood after sorting all of the boarding pass IDs. It was awesome how in the end all of the boarding pass IDs were in sequential order besides one missing on, ours! This was definitely a fun puzzle and I have a lot of respect for the creator and all the behind-the-scenes work!
