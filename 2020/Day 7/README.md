# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 7

This puzzle definitely reminded be about a certain SpongeBob candy bar bag! I spent way too long parsing the data into my own data type and got lost within my own loops a couple of times. This was all worth it as I mapped every bag name to a vector of my custom bag structure that allows me to see all bags any bag contains and their quantities. This made the actual problem very easy to solve using a bit of recursion. I also didn't have to make any changes to my structure for part 2 which was definitely a plus! I could have optimized the searching using memoization, but since the input was fairly small, I didn't find it necessary. For now, enjoy my SpongeBob visualization of this puzzle!
