# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 17

This is the latest I have submitted a puzzle. When day 17 came out, I had an Amazon interview the next day. I decided to only do part 1 that night so that I may get a good night rest for the interview and prepare a bit more in the morning. After I completed the interview, I was exhausted and to put it simply, I did not feel like dealing with 4 dimensions. This also resulted in me not starting day 18 as I didn't want to move on. My plan is to quickly finish day 18 so that I can get back on track and start day 19 when it is released tonight. For the approach of this problem, I literally just modeled the 4D universe using a 4d map basically. I chose this over a vector so that I can access things in a negative index and make the problem very simple and intuitive. This is by no means the most optimal method, but it gets the job done without frying the brain.
