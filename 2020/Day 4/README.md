# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 4

What a great puzzle for object oriented programming! My code would have been a whole lot messier if I didn't make a passport class with various functions. I again was very fortunate to have written part 1 in such a way that part 2 simply involved creating another method within my class that checks the critera specified. I took this day slow to make my code as clean as possible as I went along and it paid off! For this puzzle it was also very important to constantly test your code as you went along as it would be a nightmare trying to figure out why you aren't getting the correct count otherwise. Once again another great puzzle, on to the next tomorrow!
