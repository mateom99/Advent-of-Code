# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 2

After not getting on the leaderboard yesterday I decided that today I wasn't even going to try. I would just immerse myself and take it slow.

I decided to parse the input with getline() based on the pattern. I even went ahead and made an abstract data type to hold all the info. This was definitely the longest step. The rest remainder was fairly simple once we had out data type as we just had to track the number of times the required character appeared for part 1 and make sure it only appeared in one of the two positions for part two. Overall it was a fun puzzle and I am looking forward to tomorrow's challenge!
