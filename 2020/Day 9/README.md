# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 9

I'm glad that we got a really simple puzzle today because I was already burnt out from two final exams I took today. This also made me very lazy and so I simply bruteforced both parts of this problem today as they were quite simple. I still however completed this solution in an object oriented manner with my xmas class. Time to get some rest and complete the last of my exams tomorrow and work on day 10!
