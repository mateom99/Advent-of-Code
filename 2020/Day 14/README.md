# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 14

This was one of the funnest puzzles of this year! I went with an object-oriented approach and it made the problem much easier to solve. One mistake I initially made was creating a vector of long ints to store the memory. While this worked okay for part one, I quickly realized that I do not have 550GB to spare. I switched to an unordered_map for my memory like I should have used in the first place and everything else went smooth. I loved having to work with some bit-level operations and overall really enjoyed the puzzle!
