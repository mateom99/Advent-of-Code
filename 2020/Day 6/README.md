# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 6

I am really enjoying these puzzles that can be done with some object oriented programming. My entire solution was practically written in the groupAnswers class and all the updating was done with methods of the class. This puzzle was definitly easier than the last couple of days but I am enjoying the flow of story. Interested as to what will happen tomorrow when we land!
