# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 1

I wanted to at least try to make it on the leaderboard for day 1. I refreshed the page at exactly midnight EST and went straight to the examples. I immediately noticed that it was classic 2sum and I already had skeleton code for reading a text file line by line in a vector. It was 12:01:30 when I got my result. I am thinking that wow, I might actually have a shot! Unforuntely, the page was down and I could not submit. By the time the site came back online I was placed 300-something. Tough luck! Nevertheless it was a cool twoSum and threeSum problem that I obviously quickly did in O(N^2) and O(N^3) to try to finish as quickly in possible. It would definitly be more efficient to use a hash map in practice!
