# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 10

All that Dynamic Programming practice finally paid off! I was surprised how simple part 1 of this puzzle was but the real meat was in part 2. Part 2 was very easy to solve in O(N) if you know about [Dynamic Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/) and can recognize the pattern. I am sure that one *could* possibly bruteforce this problem but considering the answer is in the hundred trillions (even warned by the creator), it is likely to take hours upon hours to run. Overall, I enjoyed today's puzzle and am glad I got to apply some DP to it!
