# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 12

Another AoC day, another object-oriented answer! Today's puzzle was again very straightforward and fun to code. At first it seemed like part 2 was going to be tough having to deal with a waypoint rotating around the ship, but it turned out to be very easy if you just looked at the coordinates since they're all relative to the ship. I may do a visualization of this one in the morning with some sort of radar - I'll think more about how to do it in my sleep!
