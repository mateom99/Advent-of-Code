# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 8

Being a Computer Engineering Major I have to say that this has been my favorite Advent of Code puzzle so far! Over the summer my University Research focused on creating a [32-bit RISC-V processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) in both VHDL and SystemVerilog. While this handheld game proccesor was much simpler, I was able to apply some simple concepts to it as well! I really hope that we get to build on this processor in future days. My entire solution is in a single class and was created to be easily expanded for future instructions and functions.
