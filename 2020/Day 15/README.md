# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 15

I definitely had to re-read this puzzle many times until I understood what was being asked. Once I did understand however, the puzzle was not hard to implement at all. I went about part 1 assuming that I would need to know all of the times a number was spoken so I mapped each spoken number to a vector of turns in which it had been spoken. I was pretty surprised that part 2 was as simple as finding the 30 millionth word spoken and without changing anything, I got the answer with a runtime of 20 seconds. I could optimize my solution a bit and also save some memory by only storing the previous two times a number was said tonight or I could go to sleep knowing I solved the puzzle... Zzzz
